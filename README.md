# TapjackingDemo
A hacker window shows for testing whether Tap Jacking handled in your app.

When this app started, it will show a view on top of device screen/your app.

If your app's layout / view has set:
```
android:filterTouchesWhenObscured="true"
```
The clicking action will be blocked, otherwise the clicking action will handle as usual.

You can get rid of this window by uninstall the demo.
